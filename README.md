# Radar Command

![Radar Command](images/Radar%20Command.png)

## Overview
Radar Command is a retro-inspired game that simulates Cold War-era radar defense systems. Players must track and intercept incoming missiles on an oscilloscope-like radar screen. The game is heavily inspired by early warning networks and the limitations of vintage analog systems, drawing inspiration from early video games like *Tennis for Two*.

## Gameplay
Players control a crosshair on the radar screen, moving it to intercept incoming missiles. The goal is to destroy as many missiles as possible before they reach the radar center. The game features:

- A radar screen displaying incoming missiles.
- Player-controlled crosshair to intercept missiles.
- Infinite waves of incoming missiles.
- Score tracking for destroyed missiles and a counter for missed ones.
- A simple black-and-white visual style reminiscent of early electronic displays.

## Controls
- **WASD** - Move the crosshair.
- **SPACE** - Fire an interception at the current crosshair location.
- **ESC** - Quit the game.

## Installation & Running the Game
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (if not already installed).
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install pygame
    ```
3. Run the game:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

## Technology
Radar Command is built using Python and Pygame to emulate the aesthetics and mechanics of early analog radar systems. The game follows the design philosophy of hardware-limited, two-tone visuals to enhance the Cold War-era feel.
